<h1 id="sigma16-source-directory">Sigma16 source directory</h1>
<p>This is the README file for the Sigma16 source directory.</p>
<p>Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and teaching in computer systems. This application provides a complete environment for experimenting with the architecture.</p>
<h2 id="internet-links">Internet links</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>For up to date information, and to run the software, visit the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a>. That page also contains links to documentation, past releases, and the source repository. It’s best to bookmark the home page, which always points to the latest version. Don’t bookmark a specific release.</p></li>
<li><p>The URL for the source code repository is <a href="https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16/">https://github.com/jtod/Sigma16/</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="download-and-links-to-local-files">Download and links to local files</h2>
<p>To run the IDE (the graphical user interface) there is no need to download or install the software: you can just run it in a browser by clicking the <em>Launch Sigma16</em> link in the <a href="https://jtod.github.io/home/Sigma16/">Sigma16 Home Page</a>.</p>
<p>The command line tools do require downloading and installing the software. These include a standalone version of the IDE, circuit simulator, and more. See the Installation section of the User Guide.</p>
<p>If you copy the Sigma16 source directory onto your computer, the following links will run it locally without requiring further access to the Internet. However, these links will not work if you’re reading this page on the source repository on GitHub via the Internet.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="./app/Sigma16.html">Launch from files in this directory</a> If you have copied this directory onto a local machine, this link will run it. The advantage is that you won’t need access to the Internet. However, browsers have restricted access to your file system, to ensure security. One consequence of this is that the <em>Select example</em> button in the <em>Examples</em> page won’t do anything. But you can select the text of the example with your mouse, right-click and Copy, then Paste it into the Editor page. It’s also possible to install Sigma16 as an app on your computer; that gets rid of the restrictions on file access. See the Installation section in the User Guide.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="./">Up to the top directory</a> Show the listing of files in the directory containing this version.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="about-the-software">About the software</h2>
<p>The Sigma16 app (the integrated development environment – i.e. the GUI) is implemented in JavaScript, html 5, and css. The digital circuit is implemented in Hydra, which requires Haskell. Additional software tools, including a high speed emulator, are in progress and expected to be available in late 2020.</p>
