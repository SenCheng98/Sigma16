# The following lines include a message giving the current version
# number (VERSION.txt) and a message giving a pointer to the github
# page where the latest version can be found (LATESTVERSION).  That
# way, if a user is running an older version, the user guide will tell
# them where to go to to upgrade.

# The following version messages should come after the title but
# before the table of contents, so the version is clearly visible but
# not too long and obtrusive.
