# Sigma16

## Finding the documentation

* For brief release notes, see index.html, Readme.md, and LICENSE.
  These files are in the Sigma folder.

* The user manual is available as html in
  datafiles/doc/html/index.html.  If that file doesn't exist, you can
  read the markdown source in src/docsrc.index.md.

## Launching Sigma16

* Launch the executable file Sigma16.exe.

* If the executable doesn't exist you can build the software from source.

## To build the software

If your Sigma folder already contains the executable file Sigma16.exe.
See the section Launching Sigma16.

If you don't have the executable file, you can build the software.
You need only download and install Haskell Tool Stack; this will
automatically download and install the rest of the software you need.
The installation will require several GB of secondary storage.

* Visit https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/

* This page gives instructions on how to install Stack on Linux,
  Macintosh, and Windows, along with download links.
  
* Open a shell, change to the Sigma directory, and enter this command:

```
stack build Sigma16
```
