    <h1>Welcome to Sigma16</h1>
    <p> Sigma16 is a computer architecture designed for research and
      teaching in computer systems.  This application provides a
      complete environment for experimenting with the architecture,
      including an editor, assembler, linker, emulator, and an
      integrated development environment.  There is a digital circuit
      that implements the architecture, which is specified using the
      Hydra functional hardware description language.  Hydra can
      simulate the circuit, and machine language programs can run on
      both the emulator and the circuit.
