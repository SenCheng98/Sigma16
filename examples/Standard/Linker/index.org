This example program consists of two modules: a main program and a
subroutine.
- First load each module into the editor and assemble it
- In the modules page, make sure the main program is Selected
- Go to the Linker page and click Link.  This will produce and
  executable module.
- Go to the Processor page and click Boot.  The main program will be
  loaded into memory, followed by the subroutine.  Furthermore, the
  addresses in the machine language code for all the external
  references will be adjusted to the correct locations.
- Step through the program.

Here are the source files for the two modules:

- [[./Main.asm.txt][Main]] A main program that imports Mod1
- [[./Mod1.asm.txt][Mod1]] A module that exports values used by Main
